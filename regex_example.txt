# This is an example of a RegEx substitution list that can be used by Mediawiki-Pybot.
# Use Python RegEx ("re" module) for writing patterns.
# (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax)

# Format:
# Write one substitution per line, with both strings surrounded by double quotes and separated by a space:
# "Pattern to be found in text" "Text to substitute matched pattern"
# Any line that doesn't start with " is ignored, and can be used for comments.

# Examples:
## Fixing typos
"Cateogry" "Category"
## Renaming categories
"\[\[Category:Testing\]\]" "[[Category:Tested]]"
## Using capture groups
"(\d\d\d\d) Releases" "Released in \1"
